# hello-world

The year is devided into four seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter.
In spring nature awakens from her long winter sleep. The trees are filled with new life. The earth is warmed by the rays of the sun. The fields and the meadows are covered with fresh green grass. The woods and the forests are filled with the songs of the birds. The sky is blue and cloudless. At night millions of stars shine in the darkness.
